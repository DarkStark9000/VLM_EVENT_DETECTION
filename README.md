# Visual Understanding Chat Assistant

An AI-powered video analysis and conversational assistant that processes video input, recognizes events, summarizes content, and engages in multi-turn conversations.

## Project Overview

This system implements a comprehensive visual understanding chat assistant that:

- Analyzes video content using Vision-Language Models (VLM)
- Detects events and timestamps with high accuracy
- Identifies safety violations and guideline adherence issues
- Engages in natural conversations about video content
- Maintains conversation context across multiple turns
- Provides structured responses with relevant timestamps

## Key Features

### Video Event Recognition and Summarization
The system accepts video streams up to 2 minutes duration. It identifies specific events within videos such as accidents, traffic violations, pedestrian behavior, conversations, performances, and daily activities. The system provides precise timestamps for all detected events and summarizes video content highlighting key events. It detects guideline adherence and violations with detailed descriptions.

### Multi-Turn Conversations
The system supports natural, contextual conversations about video content. It retains conversation history for coherent follow-up responses. The system implements agentic workflow for intelligent query understanding. It handles clarification requests and follow-up questions and provides suggested questions based on video analysis.

### Video Input Processing
The system processes various video formats including MP4, WebM, and AVI. It handles videos up to 2 minutes duration. The system extracts representative frames for analysis and provides detailed video metadata and duration information.

```bash
docker run -d --name vlm \
  --gpus device=0 \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v /mnt/models:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  -e HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_token_here \
  vllm/vllm-openai:latest \
  --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct \
  --trust-remote-code \
  --max-model-len 2048
```

LLM Server on Port 8001 for conversations:
```bash
docker run -d --name llm \
  --gpus device=1 \
  -p 8001:8000 \
  -v /mnt/models:/root/.cache/huggingface \

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verify Setup
Test system components:
```bash
python test_system.py
```

Check API health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

### Start Application
```bash
python main.py
```

The web interface will be available at: http://localhost:8002

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Usage Flow

1. Upload Video
Navigate to http://localhost:8002. Click "Choose File" and select a video (maximum 2 minutes). Click "Analyze Video" and wait for analysis to complete (typically 30-60 seconds).

2. Review Analysis Results
View detected events with timestamps. Read the video summary. Check for any safety violations or guideline issues.

3. Start Conversation
Use the chat interface to ask questions about the video. Ask follow-up questions for clarification. Request specific details about events or timestamps.

### Example Interactions

#### Video Analysis Example
The system displays detected events such as "Person Walking (00:15 - 00:30): Individual crosses street using crosswalk" and "Vehicle Movement (00:05 - 00:20): Green bus travels along main road with other vehicles visible". Summary describes overall video content highlighting key activities and interactions.

#### Conversation Examples

User asks "What happened at the intersection?" Assistant responds with specific details about detected events including timestamps and descriptions of activities observed.

User asks "Can you tell me more about the accident?" Assistant provides detailed analysis of incident including time range, vehicles involved, and circumstances based on video analysis.

User asks "Were there any safety violations?" Assistant identifies specific safety issues detected in video analysis with precise timestamps and severity assessment.

### Advanced Features

#### Time-based Queries
Users can ask "What happened at 01:30?" or "Show me events between 00:15 and 00:45" or "When did the accident occur?" System responds with relevant timestamp information.

#### Event-specific Queries
Users can request "Tell me about the traffic violations" or "Were there any pedestrian safety issues?" or "What vehicles were involved in the accident?" System provides focused analysis of specific event types.

#### Follow-up Conversations
Users can ask "Can you explain that in more detail?" or "What were the consequences of that action?" or "How serious was that violation?" System maintains context across conversation turns.

## Testing

### Test with Sample Videos
Run comprehensive system test:
```bash
python test_system.py
```

Test specific video:
```bash
python -c "
import asyncio
from video_processor import VideoProcessor

async def test():
    processor = VideoProcessor()
    result = await processor.analyze_video('eval_dataset/test_sample1.webm')
    print(result)

asyncio.run(test())
"
```

### API Testing
Test video upload:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/analyze-video" \
  -F "video=@eval_dataset/test_sample1.webm"
```

Test chat functionality:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What events happened?", "session_id": "test_session", "user_id": "test_user"}'
```

## Performance Metrics

### Analysis Speed
Video processing takes 30-60 seconds for 2-minute videos. Event detection identifies 15-30 events detected per video. Response time under 3 seconds for chat responses.

### Accuracy
Event detection provides high precision for traffic and safety events. Timestamp accuracy within 2 seconds precision. Conversation relevance maintains context-aware responses.

### Resource Usage
GPU memory usage approximately 15GB for VLM and 8GB for LLM. CPU shows moderate usage during video processing. Storage uses temporary files with automatic cleanup.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Set custom model endpoints:
```bash
export VLM_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000/v1"
export LLM_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8001/v1"
```

Set database path:
```bash
export DB_PATH="./chat_history.db"
```

Set temporary file directory:
```bash
export TEMP_DIR="./temp"
```

### Model Configuration
Modify video_processor.py and chat_handler.py to use different models. Adjust max_tokens, temperature, and other parameters as needed. Configure frame extraction settings for different video types.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### vLLM Servers Not Responding
Check container status with `docker ps`. Check logs with `docker logs vlm` and `docker logs llm`. Restart if needed with `docker restart vlm llm`.

#### Video Analysis Fails
Ensure video file is valid and under 2 minutes duration. Check GPU memory availability. Verify video format compatibility.

#### Chat Responses Poor Quality
Check LLM server status. Verify analysis context is properly formatted. Review conversation history length.

### Performance Optimization
Reduce max_frames in video processor for faster analysis. Adjust max_tokens in chat handler for shorter responses. Use GPU monitoring to optimize memory usage.
